# NYC-AirBnb-EDA-Seaborn
This project dives into the NYC Airbnb dataset to uncover insights about pricing, room types, and location trends using Python data visualization libraries â€” **Seaborn** and **Matplotlib**.

##  Objective

To perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) and visualize key factors affecting Airbnb pricing in different NYC boroughs.

## Key Insights

-  **Manhattan** listings, especially entire homes, have the highest prices.
-  **Private rooms** are the most affordable option citywide.
-  **Brooklyn** and **Manhattan** dominate the listing count.
-  Outliers are present in high-end areas, skewing price averages.

## Visualizations

- Bar plots with `hue` (room types by neighborhood group)
- Price distribution plots with annotations
- Count plots of listings across boroughs
- Callout values added on bar charts for better readability

## Technologies Used

- Python 3
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook
